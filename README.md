# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
This project predicts breast cancer presence using machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).

## Dataset
UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

## Methodology
- Data preprocessing
- Feature selection
- Model training and evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve)

## Results
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 97.34%
- Random Forest Accuracy: XX.XX%

## Future Work
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Exploring deep learning models

## Conclusion
Both models performed well on the classification task.
